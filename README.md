#  Assignment - To create a page to display listing of photo with pagination and on click you will get popup and the popup is a slide show using Node API and React as a frontend for backend you can use Mongo and images you can use any random images.

## Response - I have created the  assignment that includes the following functionality:

1. Photo Listing Page: created a web page that displays a list of photos using React as the frontend. The photos are fetched from Node API, which is connected to a MongoDB database.

2. Popup Slideshow: When the user clicks on a photo in the listing, a popup appears displaying the clicked photo along with its. The popup acts as a slideshow, allowing the user to view the photos one by one.
   
3. Pagination: The photo listing is paginated, meaning that the user can navigate through multiple pages to view more photos.

4. Random Images: I have used random images as placeholders for your photo listing. These images are fetched from the MongoDB database.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
